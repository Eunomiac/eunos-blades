## Overview
A brutally over-designed, insanely over-complicated, utterly unwieldy system implementation for **Blades in the Dark** by [Evil Hat Productions](https://evilhat.com/) for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

## Gorgeous Sheets for All Four Character Types!

## Tons of Features for Running a Game!

### Progress Clocks!
An easy controller for the GM, grouped into keys for display to players.

### Collaborative Roll Control!
Whenever a player makes a roll, screens pop up for both the player and the GM to aid in collaborating on the details of the roll.

The roll dialog is automatically populated with all abilities, effects and applicable factors, and updates in real time as both players make modifications:
